Easy to create Shiny App for Product Recommendation using Association Rules

I created this Shiny App to hep people understand the concepts of Market Basket Analysis and how one can move from basic output for Market basket to a full fledged Product Recommendation tool.
We'll be using the following packages in R:

1. shiny
2. tidyverse
3. Matrix
4. recommenderlab
5. shinywidgets

I have also provided example datasets for people to try their hands on this app. 
Please feel free to add more functionality and personalize the app.

Further potential actions or improvements that can be made by incorporating more data:

1. Provide more details on Pricing of each individual recommended items
2. Provide a look on what is the confidence, support and lift for every recommendation
3. Make this App look prettier with additional visualizations 
etc..
